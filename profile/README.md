# Welcome to the Python Kampala Developer Community
Pykampala community is a large group of developers that are enthusiatic about python 
and its use.

We usually hold monthly meetups at different venues that are always communicated in advance
and we have a series of virtual conferences as well.

We have platform discussions you can join in and engage with the community about the events
and projects we work on as a community.
